# MIP Solver API - Implementation Tasks

This document breaks down the work required to implement the MIP Solver API based on the detailed design.

### Project Setup
- [x] **Initialize Project Structure**: Create the necessary directories (`src/mip_api`, `tests`).
- [x] **Define Dependencies**: Configure `pyproject.toml` with all required libraries (`fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `pydantic`, `pulp`, `httpx`).
- [x] **Configure Linter**: Set up `ruff` for code quality.

### Core API & Data Models
- [x] **Implement Data Models**: Create the `MIPProblem` and `MIPSolution` Pydantic models.
- [x] **Create API Endpoints**: Implement the main FastAPI application with the `/solve`, `/solve-stream`, and `/solver-info` endpoints.
- [x] **Build Solver Service**: Develop the `MIPSolverService` to handle the logic of orchestrating the problem-solving process.

### Solver Integration
- [x] **Develop Solver Wrapper**: Create a dedicated module to wrap the SCIP solver's command-line interface.
- [x] **Implement Solving Logic**: Integrate the wrapper with the `MIPSolverService` to execute the solver for the `/solve` endpoint.
- [x] **Implement Log Streaming**: Add the real-time log streaming functionality for the `/solve-stream` endpoint.

### Python Client Library
- [x] **Create Client Package**: Set up the structure for the installable Python client library.
- [x] **Implement PuLP Interface**: Create the custom solver class that inherits from PuLP's `LpSolver`.
- [x] **Implement API Communication**: Add the logic for the client to send problems to the API and parse the results.

### Testing & Documentation
- [x] **Write Unit & Integration Tests**: Develop a comprehensive test suite for the API and client.
- [x] **Create Docker Configuration**: Build `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for easy deployment.
- [x] **Update Documentation**: Write a `README.md` with instructions on how to set up and use the API and client.
