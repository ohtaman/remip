# Requirements Specification: Kill Solver on HTTP Disconnect

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for implementing a mechanism to automatically terminate the SCIP solver process when the associated HTTP client connection is closed. This is crucial for efficient resource management, especially when handling large optimization problems that might otherwise run indefinitely, consuming server resources unnecessarily.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### FR1: Detect Client Disconnection
The system SHALL detect when an HTTP client connection, associated with an active SCIP solver process, is closed or disconnected prematurely.

### FR2: Terminate Solver Process
Upon detection of a client disconnection (FR1), the system SHALL immediately terminate the corresponding SCIP solver process.

### FR3: Resource Cleanup
Upon termination of the solver process (FR2), the system SHALL ensure that all associated system resources (e.g., memory, temporary files, process handles) are properly released and cleaned up.

### FR4: Graceful Handling of Solver Completion
If the SCIP solver process completes successfully or reaches its own internal termination criteria (e.g., time limit, optimality) *before* the client connection is closed, the system SHALL NOT terminate the solver process and SHALL return the solution as per existing functionality.

### FR5: Error Logging
If a solver process is terminated due to client disconnection, the system SHALL log this event, including relevant details such as the problem ID, client ID (if available), and the reason for termination.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR1: Performance
The mechanism for detecting client disconnection and terminating the solver SHALL have minimal overhead on the overall performance of the solver and the FastAPI application.

### NFR2: Reliability
The termination mechanism SHALL be reliable, ensuring that solver processes are consistently terminated upon client disconnection.

### NFR3: Scalability
The solution SHALL be scalable to handle multiple concurrent solver processes and client connections without degradation in performance or reliability.

### NFR4: Security
The termination mechanism SHALL not introduce any security vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized termination of processes.

## 4. Out of Scope
*   Detailed client-side implementation for handling disconnections.
*   Advanced process management features beyond simple termination (e.g., pausing, resuming).
*   Customizable termination signals or methods (default termination signal will be used).
